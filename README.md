This is the code repository of Cemu, a Wii U emulator that is able to run most Wii U games and homebrew in a playable state.
It's written in C/C++ and is being actively developed with new features and fixes.

Cemu is currently only available for 64-bit Windows, Linux & macOS devices.

## Download

You can download the latest Cemu releases for Windows, Linux and Mac from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu/releases/). For Linux you can also find Cemu on [flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/info.cemu.Cemu).

On Windows, Cemu is available both as an installer and in a portable format, where no installation is required besides extracting it in a safe place.

The native macOS build is currently purely experimental and should not be considered stable or ready for issue-free gameplay. There are also known issues with degraded performance due to the use of MoltenVK and Rosetta for ARM Macs. We appreciate your patience while we improve Cemu for macOS.

Pre-2.0 releases can be found on Cemu's [changelog page](https://cemu.info/changelog.html).

## Build Instructions

To compile Cemu yourself on Windows, Linux or macOS, view [BUILD.md](/BUILD.md).

## Skylander API LAN discovery

When the Skylander API server is enabled, Cemu is configured for LAN access by default:

- Default HTTP bind host/port: `0.0.0.0:28777`
- Default HTTPS bind host/port: `0.0.0.0:28778` (optional, disabled by default)
- mDNS/DNS-SD service advertised for discovery: `_cemu-skylander._tcp.local`
- UDP fallback discovery listener: port `28779` (probe payload: `CEMU_SKYLANDER_DISCOVERY_V1`)

The API health/info endpoint is available at:

- `GET /api/skylanders/health`
- `GET /api/skylanders/info`

Both return server status, version, endpoint/discovery metadata, and capabilities so clients can validate that they found the correct LAN server.

### Network and firewall requirements

- Phone/tablet and host PC must be on the same local subnet.
- On Windows, use a Private network profile and allow inbound traffic for Cemu.
- Allow inbound TCP on the configured API port (`28777` by default).
- Allow inbound UDP on `5353` (mDNS) and `28779` (fallback discovery) when discovery is needed.

### HTTPS on LAN

HTTPS is optional for local networks. If enabled, mobile clients must trust the configured certificate chain used by Cemu (`HTTPS cert` + `HTTPS key` in Emulated USB Devices settings), otherwise TLS validation will fail.

## Issues

Issues with the emulator should be filed using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu/issues).  
The old bug tracker can be found at [bugs.cemu.info](https://bugs.cemu.info) and still contains relevant issues and feature suggestions.

## Contributing

Pull requests are very welcome. For easier coordination you can visit the developer discussion channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/5psYsup) or alternatively the [Matrix Server](https://matrix.to/#/#cemu:cemu.info).
Before submitting a pull request, please read and follow our code style guidelines listed in [CODING_STYLE.md](/CODING_STYLE.md).

If coding isn't your thing, testing games and making detailed bug reports or updating the (usually outdated) compatibility wiki is also appreciated!
